# conduction ?

# Basics

- **Leads**:
12 lead (6 limb, 6 chest/pericordial)

- **Conduction of Leads**:
red -> rt arm
black -> rt leg ()
yellow -> lt arm
green -> lt leg
augmented leads arises from those leads forms triangle (avL, avR, avF)

V1 -> 
V2 ->
V3 -> 
V4 -> 
V5 -> 
V6 -> 

## Leads relation to the heart

- **Inferior wall**: L2, L3, avL
- **Lateral wall**:
    - **High**: L1, avL
    - **Low**: V5, V6 (lt pericordial leads)
- **Anterior wall**:
    - **Septal**: V1, V2 (rt pericordial leads)
    - **Strict anterior**: V3, V4 (mid pericordial leads)

## Waves
![[ECG-waves-segments-and-intervals.jpg]]

- ### P-wave
Atrial Deporalization
+ve in all leads except avR, usually biphasic in L1 (+ve deflection for rt and -ve for lt)
3 x 2.5 ssq

- ### PRS
arrest of electricity in AVN
from end of P to beginning of QRS
iso-electfic
~ 1 ssq

- ### PRI
P + PRS
from beginning of P to beginning of QRS
iso-electric
width: 3:5 ssq

- ### QRS
Ventricular deporalization
width: < 2.5 ssq
maybe **represent** as:
monophasic: Q (named QS), R
biphasic: RS, QR
triphasic: QRS, RSR-dash

ECG voltage:
the biggest complex in limb leads must be > 1 bsq &
2 bsq in pericordial leads -> if not -> low voltage ECG &
complexes in L1, L2, L3 > 3 bsq

#### Q-wave
first -ve wave in the complex

two forms:
    - < 1x1 ssq -> dt septal deporalization -> normal in all leads except V1, V2, V3
    - > 1x1 ssq -> normal in avR, V1, L3 (in L3 disappears if breathing in)

#### RS
may or may not be found (one of them)
 **R**:
 starts small in V1 the grows bigger to reach max in V5 (R prgression) & revert in V6
 first +ve wave in the complex
 may appear again after S (called R`)
 **S**:
 opposit to R in progression (S regression)
 first -ve wave after R
 
 they become nearly equal at v3 or v4 (called transitional zone)
 if reach V4 and still R<S or V3 and R<3 ssq  -> poor progression of R

#### J-Point
the junction between QRS and STS
iso-electric (there may be elevation or depression by 1 ssq)

#### STS
iso-electric
?

#### T-wave
+ve in all leads (-ve in avR, usually -ve in V1)
asymmetrical (peak is closer to the end)
< 1 bsq in limb leads & 2 bsq in chest leads
if > normal measures -> hyperacute T-wave
wide -> ischemia
narrow -> hyperkalemia

**Discordant T-wave**: if depolarization is affected the repolarization will, secondarly, be affected too -> any wide QRS is followed by discordant T (reverses direction) as in rt BBB

#### TBS
iso-electric
the baseline for iso-electricity (used as standard for others)

# Diagnostic schema
*order is very important !*: if found abnormality .. discard the ones after it

1. AV Block & Arrythmia
in long strip (L2).. if not found look at all leads
atrial -> V1 -> p-waves
ventricular -> V5 -> QRS

2. Atrial enlagement -> BBB -> ventricular enlargement
atrial enlargment -> L2, V1
BBB & ventricular enlargment:
rt -> V1, V2
lt -> V5, V6

3. Axis and Hemi-block
in limb leads.. L1, avF

4. MI & MI
inferior -> L2, L3, avF
anterior -> V1:6
lateral ->L1, avL

5. Misc:
    1. low voltage ECG (see QRS complex in basics)
    2. hyperK
    3. Digitalis effect
    4. pre-excitation syndroms (WPW)
    5. pericarditis

# Atrial enlargment
in L2 & V1
presence of one sign is diagnostic

**Right**:
wide (> 3 ssq) & notched (M-shaped)
P mitral
mcc: mitral valve diseases

*or* if p-wave is biphasic & +ve deflection > 1x1 ssq

**Left**:
tall and peaked (> 2.5 ssq)
P pulmonale
mcc: pulmonary diseases (pul.HTN, ch. pulm embolism)

*or* if p-wave is biphasic & -ve deflection is > 1.5 ssq tall

**BI**:
features of both

# BBB
*look at the width of the QRS* because if there is BBB the conduction will be slower

< 2.5 ssq -> normal
2.5:3 ssq -> incomplete BBB
≥ 3 ssq    -> complete BBB

**Right**:
in V1, V2
RSR-dash & R is wide
monophasic R (± notched) (called RR-dash.. no S (no -ve wave below baseline)
maybe not notched -> monophasic R

\+ in V5, V6 (or L1, avL)
slurred S (wider than its preceeding R)

\+ discordant T in V1, V2

**Left**:
in V1, V2
wide normal shaped QRS (QS or RS)

\+ in V5, V6
monophasic R (± notched)

\+ discordant T in V5, V6

*hyperK with BBB*: intraventricular conduction delay

# Vent. enlargement
in V1, V2, V5, V6

**Right**:
reverse of normal wave progression (taller R in V1, V2 & taller S in V5, V6)
*or* R-wave ≥ S-wave in V1
*or* R-wave in V1 > 7 ssq
± Q-wave in V1

strain pattern in rt pericordial leads (at least V1, V2) -> hypertrophy

**Left**:
exageration to normal wave progression (taller R in V5, V6 & S in V1, V2)
R-wave in V5 or V6 > 5 bsq
*or* R-wave in V5 or V6 + S-wave in V1 > 7 bsq

strain pattern (coughed ?) ST depression in pericordial leads (at least V5, V6) -> hypertrophy

**Bi**:
signs of both
*or* lt vent enlargement + rt axis deviation

---
# Axis
L1 & avD
normal direction of complex in both is +ve

**Right axis deviation**:
-ve in L1 & +ve in avF
mcc rt ventricular enlargement

**Left axis deviation**:
+ve in L1 & -ve in avF


**Extreme axis deviation**:
